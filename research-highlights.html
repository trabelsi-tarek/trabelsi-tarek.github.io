            <h2>Photochemical Mechanisms and Spectroscopic Properties of Magnesium and Aluminum Molecules</h2>
            <p>
                This project aims to predict the structure, spectroscopy, stability, and photochemical mechanisms of the formation and destruction of magnesium and aluminum-bearing molecules.
                This research aids in identifying these species in both Earth's atmosphere and the interstellar medium. In Earth's atmosphere, such species may form through reactions between these metals, 
                introduced via spacecraft entry and meteoroids, and abundant atmospheric components. The specific molecules we studied included AlO<sup>+</sup>, AlOH, AlNS, AlSO, AlCH, AlSO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>AlO,
                HOAlO, AlO<sub>2</sub>, AlSiO, AlPO, AlNO, AlNCO, HAlNP, HMgNC, HMgCN, and HAlNCO. This comprehensive study enhances our understanding of these molecules, 
                contributing valuable insights into atmospheric and interstellar chemistry.

           <h2>Solving the Mysteries of Venus's Atmosphere: Water Depletion and  the enigmatic near-UV absorber</h2> 
            <p>
                This ongoing project aims to investigate the depletion of water in Venus's atmosphere and the large variability of sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) and sulfur monoxide (SO).
                Understanding these phenomena is crucial for comprehending the atmospheric chemistry and climatic conditions of Venus. Recent studies have suggested that the near UV-Vis absorber, 
                a long-standing mystery in Venusian atmospheric science, may be linked to sulfur species. By examining the interactions and reactions involving water, SO<sub>2</sub>, and SO, we aim to provide  a more comprehensive
                explanation of their roles in Venus's atmospheric processes. Additionally, our research seeks to elucidate the photochemical mechanisms contributing to the observed variations in these species. 
                This study addresses the water depletion issue and strives to shed light on the enigmatic UV-Vis absorption, ultimately enhancing our understanding of Venus's complex and dynamic atmosphere
