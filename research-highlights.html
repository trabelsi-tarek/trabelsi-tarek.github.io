            <h2>Photochemical Mechanisms and Spectroscopic Properties of Magnesium and Aluminum Molecules</h2>
            <p>
                This project aims to predict the structure, spectroscopy, stability, and photochemical mechanisms of the formation and destruction of magnesium and aluminum-bearing molecules.
                This research aids in identifying these species in both Earth's atmosphere and the interstellar medium. In Earth's atmosphere, such species may form through reactions between these metals, 
                introduced via spacecraft entry and meteoroids, and abundant atmospheric components. The specific molecules we studied included AlO<sup>+</sup>,
                <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aad5e0/meta">AlOH</a>,
                AlNS, AlSO, AlSO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>AlO,
                <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aad5e0/meta">OAlOH</a>, AlO<sub>2</sub>, AlSiO,<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac36d0/meta">AlCH</a>,
                AlPO, AlNO, <a href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2023/04/aa45639-22/aa45639-22.html">AlNCO</a>,

                contributing valuable insights into atmospheric and interstellar chemistry.

           <h2>Solving the Mysteries of Venus's Atmosphere: Water Depletion and  the enigmatic near-UV absorber</h2> 
            <p>
                This ongoing project aims to investigate the depletion of water in Venus's atmosphere and the large variability of sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) and sulfur monoxide (SO).
                Understanding these phenomena is crucial for comprehending the atmospheric chemistry and climatic conditions of Venus. Recent studies have suggested that the near UV-Vis absorber, 
                a long-standing mystery in Venusian atmospheric science, may be linked to sulfur species. By examining the interactions and reactions involving water, SO<sub>2</sub>, and SO, we aim to provide  a more comprehensive
                explanation of their roles in Venus's atmospheric processes. Additionally, our research seeks to elucidate the photochemical mechanisms contributing to the observed variations in these species. 
                This study addresses the water depletion issue and strives to shed light on the enigmatic UV-Vis absorption, ultimately enhancing our understanding of Venus's complex and dynamic atmosphere.

            <h2>Sulfur Photochemistry in Earth's and Venus's Atmospheres: Implications for Climate Change Mitigation</h2> 
            <p>
                Studying the chemical makeup of other planets in the universe helps us to understand chemistry in the present Earth’s atmosphere. A hot topic of Venus is understanding the impact of 
                sulfur in the atmospheric environment of Venus. This turns out to be very important for understanding the impact of sulfur in the atmosphere of Earth. In particular, a very 
                topically current issue in geoengineering Earth with sulfur compounds. With climate change so difficult to manage and nations unwilling to take decisive action, what if we could
                mitigate its effects by setting up a kind of chemical umbrella a layer of sulfuric acid in the upper atmosphere that could reflect the sun’s radiation and cool the Earth? 
                This is the foundation of geoengineering intentional changes to planetary-scale processes that tilt the climate in society’s favor. The aim is to generate sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>),
                in the right part of the atmosphere, such that it might reflect enough sunlight to slow the Earth’s warming. In this project, we examined the photochemistry of many sulfuric and
                how they react to light in the Earth's atmosphere. We used high-level quantum chemical and new ab initio molecular dynamics methodologies to assess the potential impact of 
                photochemistry of these species. The significant finding from these studies reveals that <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/jacs.1c10153">HOSO<sub>2</sub></a> absorbs a lot of light in the stratosphere and could undergo photolysis on short
                timeframes, while SO<sub>3</sub> might instead linger. Additionally, we found that the production of SO + OH from the photodissociation of <a href="https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article/151/11/111103/198866">HOSO</a> may lead to ozone depletion due to the
                reactivity of SO with ozone. The issue of climate change is one of the most pressing challenges facing our planet, and time is of the essence in finding effective solutions
                which is another way that I have been extending my research in this area. Moreover, these studies led to new findings for the chemistry of Venus that had not been explored.
